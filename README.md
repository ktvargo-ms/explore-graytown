# Explore Graytown

This repo is the source of tools, samples, tutorials, and other resources for customers of Graytown.

## Features

This project provides the following:

* Pre-configured codespace with [K3s](https://k3s.io/) cluster via [K3d](https://k3d.io/)
* Graytown M4

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Codespaces are easy to setup quickly and tear down later, but they're not suitable for performance evaluation or scale testing. For those scenarios, use a validated environment from the official documentation.
